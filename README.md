# pi-joke-dashboard

I've got a new [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and while I try to decide on a suitable hardware project I
thought I'd use it to serve a jokey IOT type dashboard direct to the internet.

I'm starting by implementing a simple static site but I'd like to eventually add a dynamic backend to give it that
"real time" feel.
